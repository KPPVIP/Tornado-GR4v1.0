Tornado GR4 [Addon] v1.0

The Tornado is a family of twin-engine, multirole combat aircraft,
which was jointly developed and manufactured by France, the United Kingdom, and West Germany.

The Tornado operators have chosen to undertake various life extension and upgrade programmes to keep their Tornado fleets as viable frontline aircraft for the foreseeable future.

With these upgrades, as of 2011, it is projected that the Tornado shall be in service until 2025, more than 50 years after the first prototype took flight.
